## Milestone 1 feedback
Nice work. Your directory structure is built to spec, and your code looks great. Nice idea here - I'm looking forward to hearing/seeing your ideas about how you'd like to present your projects on the site. Building an interactive gallery might be something worth considering.

Your purpose/audience/goal and Persona all appropriate and well done. Your Use Case is more akin to an Interaction Flow. Remember that an Interaction Flow can be a part of a Use Case, but a Use Case provides more detail on the "How, When, Where, and with What" a user will access your site - including the technology.

Your Milestone passes at [Tier III](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/) - nice work. You're clear to begin on [Milestone2 &alpha;](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/milestone-two/) 

### Edits &amp; Suggestions
- Minor thing: Keep an eye on indentation. Your &lt;p&gt; tags should be out-dented one level.
